1 INTRODUCTION
2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
3 FRAMEWORK OF SEARCH
4 TOP-K STAR MATCHING
4.1 Framework of SMat
10. sort the leaf matches in V h
11. while (|R | < k) do
15. return R as sq(G, k);
2, pivot matches A1, A2 and A3 hold the descending lists for leaf
4.2 Top-h Node Matching
35]. Based on the observation, we draw that nodes in the index IG
4.3 Edge Judging
5 TOP-K JOIN & PATTERN DECOMPOSITION
5.1 Top-k Join
3, JoinK updates lower bound as LB = 2.4. For sq2, the upper
5.2 Pattern Decomposition
2-approximate star cover.
6 EVALUATION
6.1 Setup
100 and 150, and top-50 is the default one. We report the average
1024; the learning rate is set to be 10−5; and the training batch size
6.2 Experimental Results
1.0X , where X = (cid:112)(|V |/k) · k. Fig. 9(b) shows the running time
